# Planned Revisions to Reproduction of Malcomb (2014)

Author: Andrey (Andy) Cao

## Analysis

To better the reproducibility study of Malcomb (2014), I will expand the written analysis and more directly address discrepancies between the original study and the reproduction. 

My revision to the reproducibility study of Malcomb (2014) will prioritize adding the discussion, conclusion, and 'rationale for the updated report' sections. 
Adding these three sections at the end of the study will improve the understanding of the reproduction by describing the changes made, the reasoning behind each choice, as well as the results of each change. 
This will provide the most updated conclusions of the reproducibility study. 

In addition to a more comprehensive written analysis of the reproduction, I will also address the confusion caused by the inconsistent figure labeling of the original study. 
In order to clearly represent the differences between the original study and the reproduction, I will add figures and comments to demonstrate the inconsistency with the figure labels.

## Results

The addition of a comprehensive discussion section will analyze each choice and deviation (along with the corresponding result) within the reproduction study and compare them to the original study.
The discussion section will also help explain the reasoning behind each choice/deviation.
The conclusion section will help to explain the significance of the reproduction while also addressing the study's effect on the broader scientific community. 
The rationale section will reiterate how the changes made in this version of the study improved the first reproduction of Malcomb (2014).  

Within the code, I will create figures based on the figure labels presented in the original study. 
With annotations, I will then note the discrepancies between the original labels and the figures of the original and the reproductions. 
The addition of figures and annotations will be accompanied by additions to the discussion section to strengthen the clarity of the study. 

## Discussion

If the discussion, conclusion, and rationale sections showcase the changes, the results, and an understanding of the reproduction, then the study will have a clearer and more organized analysis for future reproductions.
If the code and the discussion address the inconsistent labeling of the original study's figures, then the study will have a more direct explanation for the discrepancies between the original study and the equations used for the reproduction.


## Revision (2023-12-17)
When originally writing the preanalysis plan for this reproduction, I was quite vague with my proposed additions surrounding the "inconsistent figure labeling of the original study." 
To keep the integrity of my original preanalysis, I will provide a clearer explanation of my proposed changes as a revision to this analysis plan. 

Along with the changes to the study's discussion, conclusion, and rationale section, I will also add visualizations examining Figure 5 of the Malcomb (2014) study. 
Since the original Figure 5 is labeled as representing (vulnerability = assets + access + livelihoods - exposure), I will visualize Figure 5 using this equation. 
Additionally, I plan to implement a correlation scatter plot and a Spearman's Rho Comparison to compare the original Figure 5 to the figure using the equation. 
The addition of these visualizations should improve the transparency of the reproduction, critically examine the construct validity of the original Figure 5, and draw attention to the literature's inconsistent definition of 'vulnerability.'
