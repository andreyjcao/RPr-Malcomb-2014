#Planned Revisions to Reproduction of Malcomb (2014)

Author: Andrey (Andy) Cao

##Analysis

To better the reproducibility study of Malcomb (2014), I will be expanding the written analysis and more directly addressing discrepancies between the original study and the reproduction. 

My revision to the reproducibility study of Malcomb (2014) will prioritize adding the discussion, conclusion, and 'rationale for the updated report' sections. 

In addition to more comprehensive written  roduction, I will also address the confusion caused by the inconsistent figure labeling of the original study.

##Results

In od

##Discussion

If the discussion, conclusion, and rationale sections showcase the changes, the results, and an understanding of the reproduction, then the study will have a more clear and organized analysis for future reproductions.
If the code and the discussion addresses the inconsistent labeling of the original study's figures, then the study will have a more direct explanation for the discrepancies between the original study and the equations used for the reproduction.
