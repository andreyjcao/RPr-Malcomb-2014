#Planned Revisions to Reproduction of Malcomb (2014)

Author: Andrey (Andy) Cao

##Analysis

To better the reproducibility study of Malcomb (2014), I will be expanding the written analysis and more directly addressing discrepancies between the original study and the reproduction. 

My revision to the reproducibility study of Malcomb (2014) will prioritize adding the discussion, conclusion, and 'rationale for the updated report' sections. 
Adding these three sections at the end of the study will improve the understanding of the reproduction by describing the changes made, the reasoning behind each choice, as well as the results of each change. 
This will provide the most updated conclusions of the reproducibility study. 

In addition to more comprehensive written analysis of the reproduction, I will also address the confusion caused by the inconsistent figure labeling of the original study. 
In order to clearly represent the differences between the original study and the reproduction, I will add figures and comments to demonstrate the inconsistency with the figure labels.

##Results

The addition of a comprehensive discussion section will analyze each choice and deviation (along with the corresponding result) within the reproduction study and compare them to the original study.
The discussion section will also help explain the reasoning behind each choice/deviation.
The conclusion section will help to explain the significance of the reproduction while also addressing the study's effect on the broader scientific community. 
The rational section will reiterate how the changes made in this version of the study improved the first reproduction of Malcomb (2014).  



##Discussion

If the discussion, conclusion, and rationale sections showcase the changes, the results, and an understanding of the reproduction, then the study will have a more clear and organized analysis for future reproductions.
If the code and the discussion addresses the inconsistent labeling of the original study's figures, then the study will have a more direct explanation for the discrepancies between the original study and the equations used for the reproduction.
